## ðŸ“£ News

- [2025/04/xx]:âœ¨The training code and pertrained weight of DeGLA have been released.
- [2025/04/xx]:âœ¨The paper of [DeGLA](xx) is submitted to arXiv.
## ðŸ’¡ Highlights
We propose a simple yet effective negative caption generation pipeline that harnesses the in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce high-quality negative captions, facilitating hard negative-based fine-tuning

We introduce the DeGLA framework, which employs a self-
distillation mechanism within the global alignment to maintain
the modelâ€™s inherent general comprehension capabilities. Addi-
tionally, it combines Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and
Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) loss to improve vision-language
compositional understanding

## ðŸŽ¨ TODO
- [ ] Release training code
- [ ] Release model weight
- [ ] Release training data

## Environment installation
Our work is based on [openclip](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip),[NegCLIP](https://github.com/vinid/neg_clip), [CE-CLIP](https://github.com/lezhang7/Enhance-FineGrained), you can refer to these repository for environment setup, then modify them according to our code and proceed with the train. Alternatively, you can refer to the environment detailed below:
```base
conda create -n DeGLA python=3.9 -y
conda activate DeGLA
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Our CUDA version is 12.1. You can adjust the versions of the relevant libraries, such as PyTorch, according to your CUDA version.

## Training
Our hard negative data is released at [Baidu Yun](),[GoogleDrive]() and [Huggingface]().
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA
cd DeGLA
./scripts/train_DeGLA.sh
```
## Evaluation
Our weights is released at [Baidu Yun](),[GoogleDrive]() and [Huggingface]().
 Our compositional reansoning evaluation is based on other repositories. For ARO, please visit [ARO](https://github.com/mertyg/vision-language-models-are-bows). For SugarCrepe, please visit [SugarCrepe](https://github.com/RAIVNLab/sugar-crepe). For VALSE, please visit [VALSE](https://github.com/Heidelberg-NLP/VALSE).
